# US States Guessing Game

This Python script is an educational game that challenges users to guess the names of US states by visually selecting them on a blank US map. The game is built using the Turtle graphics library for graphical display and the Pandas library for data handling.

## How It Works

The script loads a blank map of the United States.

State data, including state names and coordinates, is read from a CSV file ("50_states.csv").

The user is prompted to guess the names of US states. They can exit the game by typing "Exit."

When the user correctly guesses a state, its name is displayed on the map, and their score increases.

After the game ends, a CSV file ("not_guessed_states.csv") is generated, listing the states that were not guessed.

## Usage Instructions

Ensure the "blank_states_img.gif" and "50_states.csv" files are in the same directory as the script.

Run the script, and a window with the blank US map will appear.

Enter state names when prompted.

To exit the game, type "Exit."

After the game, check "not_guessed_states.csv" for unguessed states.

## Note: This game is designed for educational purposes, helping users learn the names and locations of US states interactively.
